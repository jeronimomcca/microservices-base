This should have a dynamic way to load data from the web API and mount generic views
1. Request the main configurations (cofigured menu, configured data sources, configured views)
2. Open the main view wraped on the home view, which may provide menus, router, header and docker
3. All other views inherit from the base view 
3. Set the main bahavior








Roadmap:
0. Add event support using mosquitto
1. If one abject prop has other object, make they appear on the list when editing
2. Create a login view
3. make main menu able to group views by categories
